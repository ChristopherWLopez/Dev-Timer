# Stand-ups and Plannings

## Sept 5

   Log: I spent most of the day today trying to debug my chatGPT feature for this project. I am currently reading through the documentation to see if I can solve this situtation.

    Blockers: I am tryin to get this API working, howevery I am getting a lot of errors, So for my MVP this is my main blocker. 

    Tomorrow, I will spend some time reading through the documentation and spend some time applying that code as to this feature is apart of my MVP.

    After a little bit of time I will move forward and begin working on my next feature, The white-boarding will be done and I will start working on that feature.

## Yesterday

I did flesh out a few ideas as to what I figured what would get the chatGPT api to work. However I did not manage to get things going and spent plenty of time trying to debug and see if I could get the proper `response` so I could render that info within my component. This was the biggest blocker of the day and I will some time today working this out

## Today

Today I will dig further into the docs and see if I could find some info and inturn getting a clearer understanding of what I would need to do in order to make these calls actuallu return what I am looking for in order to reach my MVP. I will set aside some time and work on this feature, however if I exceed this time then I will set aside this feature and begin to white-board and lay out the workings of my feature within the [ReadMe](/README.md)

From that point I will continue on and see what becomes of the day.
