# Stand-ups and Plannings

## Sept 5

   Log: I spent most of the day today trying to debug my chatGPT feature for this project. I am currently reading through the documentation to see if I can solve this situtation.

    Blockers: I am tryin to get this API working, howevery I am getting a lot of errors, So for my MVP this is my main blocker. 

    Tomorrow, I will spend some time reading through the documentation and spend some time applying that code as to this feature is apart of my MVP.

    After a little bit of time I will move forward and begin working on my next feature, The white-boarding will be done and I will start working on that feature. 

## Sept 6

## Yesterday

I did flesh out a few ideas as to what I figured what would get the chatGPT api to work. However I did not manage to get things going and spent plenty of time trying to debug and see if I could get the proper `response` so I could render that info within my component. This was the biggest blocker of the day and I will some time today working this out

## Today

Today I will dig further into the docs and see if I could find some info and inturn getting a clearer understanding of what I would need to do in order to make these calls actuallu return what I am looking for in order to reach my MVP. I will set aside some time and work on this feature, however if I exceed this time then I will set aside this feature and begin to white-board and lay out the workings of my feature within the [ReadMe](/README.md)

From that point I will continue on and see what becomes of the day.

## 5:30

I have spent time reading docs and understanding what It was I was doing wrong and I potentially saved myself some money because, I forgot that I should be making my api calls on the server side instead of the client side. So I feel I have a better understanding. However.... I do want to make sure that I am still moving forward with my MVP goals. So I will take this time to put in a pin in this feature and move on to the other feature I have in mind that will create a more fleshed out MVP. I will return to this AI portion tomorrow.
